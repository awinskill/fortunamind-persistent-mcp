## 3. Product Requirements

### 3.1 Core Features

#### 3.1.1 Technical Indicators Tool

**Priority: P0 - Launch Critical**

**Design Principles:**
- Assume zero prior knowledge
- Explain everything in plain English
- Provide educational context
- Offer actionable insights
- Build confidence through understanding

**Supported Indicators with Beginner-Friendly Explanations:**

| Indicator | What It Measures | How It's Explained to Users |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **RSI** | Overbought/Oversold | "Like a pressure gauge - too high means expensive, too low means cheap" |
| **SMA** | Average price trends | "The average price over the last X days - shows general direction" |
| **EMA** | Recent price emphasis | "Like SMA but pays more attention to recent prices" |
| **MACD** | Momentum changes | "Shows when trends might be changing direction" |
| **Volume** | Trading activity | "How many people are buying/selling - high volume means high interest" |
| **Support/Resistance** | Price boundaries | "Prices where Bitcoin tends to stop falling or rising" |

**Example User Interaction:**
```
User: "Should I buy Bitcoin?"

FortunaMind: "Let me check the technical indicators for Bitcoin and explain what they mean:

üìä Bitcoin Analysis (Current Price: $45,234)

üü¢ **What the numbers say:**
‚Ä¢ RSI: 42 (Slightly cheap - good potential buying range)
‚Ä¢ Price vs 50-day average: 2% above (mild bullish trend)
‚Ä¢ Volume: High (lots of interest right now)

üìö **What this means in plain English:**
The RSI of 42 is like a sale price - Bitcoin isn't expensive right now. The price being above its 50-day average suggests people have been buying more than selling recently. High volume means this isn't a quiet period - there's real activity.

üí° **For a beginner:**
This could be a reasonable time to make a small purchase if you're thinking about it anyway. Bitcoin isn't screaming "overpriced" right now.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember:** No one can predict the future. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider starting with a small amount to learn.

Would you like me to explain what any of these indicators mean in more detail?"
```

**Tool Features:**
- **Educational Explanations** - Every indicator comes with plain English explanation
- **Risk Warnings** - Always include appropriate caution for beginners  
- **Context Setting** - Explain market conditions and what they mean
- **Action Guidance** - Gentle suggestions without financial advice
- **Follow-up Education** - Offer deeper explanations if requested
